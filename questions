1) Explain REST and RESTful

REST means "Representational State Transfer" it's a software architecture style that define how create web services.
It limit the exchanges between a client and a server.
A REST API his :
    - stateless, the server don't know how's the client,
    - cacheable, the client keep some data so he don't have to always ask the server,
    - client-server oriented,
    - with a uniform interface, one of the most important rule, the architecture is simplified,
    - with a layer system, thanks to intermediate servers
    - with a code on demand (optional)
RESTful apply on API, A RESTful API put into practice all the constraints imposed by REST.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)

An API allows to link a client and a database with requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). For this we link the database
to an URL. Usually the data on this URL are in JSON format. Then we execute the requests on this URL for modify the DDB.

/************************************************************************************************************************/
3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

For modify a DDB we need to execute requests.
    - GET for read data,
    - POST for create data,
    - PUT for update data,
    - DELETE for remove data

/************************************************************************************************************************/
4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?

On a stateful protocol the server keep the information of login while on a stateless protocol the server give a password to
the client and the client will said this password each time it request the server (if the password didn't change).
HTTP is a stateless protocol.

/************************************************************************************************************************/
5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)

A GET alow to obtain data so we only need the good URL to find these data.
While a POST create data so we need the good URL but we also need the data to send in the body of the request.

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?

At the beginning I wonder if I know someone who already had this problem (colleague, friends (who answer fast), slack, etc).
If nobody in my acquaintances already this problem I'll search on Google.
And if don't find something good enough I'll ask to everyone I know in dev (colleague, friends, etc).
And even if all this does not allow me to have an answer I'll stop working for coming back on it later.
